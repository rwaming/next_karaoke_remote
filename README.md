### v1.0<a name='v1.0'></a>

It will be made by React, but I heard offical React document say "Don't use create-react-app".

- I must choose what type of React to apply this project
  - ✔️ Next.js : It is mostly used in a lot ofcompany.
  - Remix
  - Gatsby
  - ~~Expo~~ is only for React Native

#### Branch

1. A branch must have only one function unit.
2. A function means that

- A target element group
- one function with something like element(input...) or event.

#### Function

At least

1. This App must have fucntions of karaoke remote control
   - Those is like 'backward', 'forward', 'applause'...
2. It is essencial to use some media contents which show karaoke screen and play MR, like Youtube(TJ channel).
   - Youtube API have to be checked.
   - I have to study how to use API, if it is possible to use Youtube API.

Foremore

1. It can be used though the user uses App with a mobile phone and a desktop.
   - Server
     - Node.js - Express
2. It has function to save some setting like pitch in either
